	<html:h3>Recognizing Trusted Forwarders</html:h3>
	
	<html:p>The email you were viewing was rejected because the apparent sender of the email
	was not authorized to use the domain name found in the From: header.  But the apparent
	sender might be wrong.  This happens often with mail lists, because the mail list servers
	aren't explicitly permitted to use the domain names of the emails they forward.</html:p>

	<html:p>If <xul:label id="servername"/> is the server for a mail list or mail forwarder that
	you subscribe to, and if you trust the server's administrators to not author malicious emails,
	then continue reading.</html:p>

	<html:h3>How do I correct the problem?</html:h3>

	<html:p>You can tell the Thunderbird SPF Extension which servers are mail lists/forwarders that you trust.
	Click <i>Trusted Forwarder</i> to remember that this server is a trusted forwarder.
	Otherwise, click <i>Nevermind</i>.</html:p>
	
	<html:p>You can edit the list of trusted forwarders by going to Tools | Extensions and opening
	the options for the SPF Extension.</html:p>
