	<title>Thunderbird SPF Extension: Trusting Fowarders</title>
</head>

<body>
	<p>(This page is under development.)</p>
	
	<P>If the server <!--#echo var="QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED" --> is
	a mail forwarding service or mail list that you trust,
	please follow these instructions.</P>
	
	<h3>Why was there a problem?</h3>

	<p>The email you were viewing was rejected because the apparent sender of the email
	was not authorized to use the domain name found in the From: header.  In other words,
	when a mail list forwards on a message preserving the From: address, there is no
	way to know whether it has "forged" the address or has really passed on a message
	from the address listed in the From: header.</p>

	<P>If you've arrived at this page, the email you were viewing was verified as coming
	from the domain above by looking at the email's hidden envelope information.  If this
	is a forwarding service or mail list that you trust, continue reading.</P>
	
	<h3>How do I correct the problem?</h3>

	<P>You can tell the Thunderbird SPF Extension which domains are forwarding services
	or mail lists that you trust to avoid this problem.  All that you are trusting is that
	the mail servers in that domain are passing on emails that they have received, and that
	those servers themselves are not forging any information in the emails.  You do not
	have to trust that the mail servers have screened the emails themselves.</P>
	
	<P>You will need to edit your Thunderbird user preferences file.  On Linux, this file
	is in ~/.thunderbird/[profile name]/[random-string]/user.js.  I don't know where this file is
	on Windows.</P>
	
	<P>Add the following line to the file.</P>
	
	<P><TT>user_pref("spf.forwarder.<!--#echo var="QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED" -->", "trust");</TT></P>
	
	<P>Then restart Thunderbird.</P>
	
	<P>Note that only domain names may be used in spf.forwarder records	in the preferences file.</P>
