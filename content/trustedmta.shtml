	<title>Thunderbird SPF Extension: Trusting Your Mail Server</title>
</head>

<body>
	<p>(This page is under development.)</p>
	
	<P>If the server <!--#exec cmd="dig +short -x $QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED" -->
	(<!--#echo var="QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED" -->) is a part of your local institution,
	please follow the instructions below.</P>
	
	<h3>Why was there a problem?</h3>

	<p>The email you were viewing was rejected because the apparent sender of the email
	was not authorized to use the domain name found in the From: header.</p>

	<P>Long story short, the Thunderbird SPF Extension will not realize if the last server to
	see the email was not the original sender but actually a mail server at your own institution.
	When this happens, the Thunderbird SPF Extension will reject the email because the mail
	server does not have the authority to use the sender's domain name.</P>
	
	<h3>How do I correct the problem?</h3>

	<P>You can tell the Thunderbird SPF Extension which servers are a part of your
	institution's email system to avoid this problem.</P>
	
	<P>You will need to edit your Thunderbird user preferences file.  On Linux, this file
	is in ~/.thunderbird/[profile name]/[random-string]/user.js.  I don't know where this file is
	on Windows.</P>
	
	<P>Add the following line to the file.</P>
	
	<P><TT>user_pref("spf.host.<!--#echo var="QUERY_STRING_UNESCAPED" -->", "trust");</TT></P>
	
	<P>Then restart Thunderbird.</P>
	
	<P>Note that only IP addresses, and not hostnames, may be used in spf.host records
	in the preferences file.</P>
